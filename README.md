# Plants-disease-classifier
A useful app for farmers which will help them detect any disease their plant might have. Extract the rar file Saved_Models. After that in order to check the health of any plant from the list(labels.txt), upload video the leaves of that plant(less than 10 sec) in the "test_videos" folder and run the program.
The program will ask you for the name of that video you saved in the folder "test_videos" along with the extection and the model will predict about the health of the plant, i.e. healthy or the type of disease that the plant may be suffering from.
